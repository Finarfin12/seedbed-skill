# Review

Read-only. List Seedbed notes that are due, then offer a session.

1. In the notes folder (and the concepts folder if configured), find Markdown files with `type: idea` or `type: concept` by searching the frontmatter (for example Grep for `^type:`) so that other notes are never opened. Ignore all other notes completely: do not list them, do not name them, and do not mention that you skipped any.
2. For each, read `status` and `review`.
3. Skip `discarded`. A note is **due** if `review` is today or earlier, or `review` is missing. Notes with an invalid `status` are listed separately as "invalid" with the bad value.
4. Show due notes grouped by status (`seed`, `growing`, `mature`), oldest `review` first, one line each: title, type, review date.
5. Offer the next step as a question (and, for notes with earlier answers, recall practice from `references/retrieval.md`): for a `seed` idea, "Want a Socratic session on <title>?". For a `growing` note offer a Devil's Advocate session; for a `seed` concept offer a Feynman check.
6. Change nothing. Do not edit `review` dates here.

If nothing is due, say so in one sentence.
